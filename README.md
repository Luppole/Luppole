## A bit about myself...

> Hi! I'm Luppole. My real name is Itamar and I'm a SWE (Software Engineer) from Israel ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡±
> One of my hobbies is information security related topics, especially ones related to spotting & exploiting system / file weaknesses (pwning).
> You can find me in https://pwnable.kr/play.php by the name "Luppole".

> I currently work for Sable, a game development studio, in the role of a Unity Developer.
> Feel free to reach me out for projects / job offerings, or even if you have a question about my projects.
